My GitHub account will be used to write and edit code. It is a very helpful tool for students to learn.
My repository is for class. It can hold all of my project's files and the revision history.
Firstly, I had to create my repository on GitHub. Then, I browsed my computer and created a folder for my repository. I saved it on my desktop for easy access.
